# A* Pathfinding Visualizer

A graphical A* pathfinding algorithm implemented in Python using the `pygame` module. This project allows users to visualize the inner workings of the A* algorithm in real-time through a clean and interactive GUI.

## Project Structure

- ```algorithm/``` : contains function for the A* path finding
- ```button/``` : contains implementation for custom button
- ```utils/``` : contains constants for GUI
- ```main.py``` : contains the aplication including big part of the alg
- ```icon.ico``` : icon for application

## Controls
- ```Start``` button allows the user to place the node where the alg will begin the search
- ```End``` button allows the user to place the end node
- ```Obstacle``` button allows the user to place obstacles
- ```Find the shortest path``` button allows the user to start alg
- ```Delete``` button allows the user to delete places node in the grind
- ```Clear All``` button allows the user to delete all nodes on the grid
- ```ESC``` stop the searching

## Features

- Real-time visualization of the A* pathfinding algorithm
- Interactive grid creation (start node, end node, walls)

## Installation

1. Clone the repo
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/astar_visualizer.git
   cd astar_visualizer
```

2. Install pygame (Note python3.x must be added to the path)
```bash
    pip install pygame
```

3. Run the aplication
```bash
    pip install pygame
```
